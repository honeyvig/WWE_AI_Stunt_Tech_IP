# AI-Assisted Wrestling Stunt Safety & Show Automation (IP Framework)

This repository documents how AI, neural networks, LLMs, sensors, 
and automated machines are used in professional wrestling 
(WWE-style productions) for:

- Dangerous stunt rehearsal
- Injury prevention
- Stage automation & pyrotechnics
- On-screen broadcast enhancement

⚠️ No autonomous robots fight humans. All wrestling is human-performed.
AI is used for safety, planning, rehearsal, and spectacle.
