# AI-Assisted Wrestling Stunt Safety & Show Automation (IP Framework)

This repository documents how AI, neural networks, LLMs, sensors, 
and automated machines are used in professional wrestling 
(WWE-style productions) for:

- Dangerous stunt rehearsal
- Injury prevention
- Stage automation & pyrotechnics
- On-screen broadcast enhancement

⚠️ No autonomous robots fight humans. All wrestling is human-performed.
AI is used for safety, planning, rehearsal, and spectacle.
📂 What this repository contains
🥋 Dangerous Stunts (Documented Safely)

High-flying jumps & aerial twists

Spine / backbone impact moves

Kicks, punches, elbow & knee strikes

Chair, table, ladder slams

Arm locks, leg locks, twisting submissions

🤖 AI & Machines (Non-violent, backstage use only)

Motion capture & VR simulators

Impact-sensing rings & smart mats

Exoskeleton-assisted training (conceptual/prototype)

Wearable injury-prediction sensors

Automated stage lifts, trapdoors, pyro systems

🧠 AI / Neural Networks / LLMs

CNNs & Vision Transformers → pose, angle, collision detection

LSTM / RNN → jump & landing trajectory prediction

Reinforcement Learning → safer stunt variations

LLMs → match scripting, cue timing, commentary sync

🎥 On-Screen AI

AI camera tracking

AI slow-motion & replay enhancement

Lighting, fog, fire synchronization

⚖️ Legal & Ethics

Clear IP boundaries (no WWE proprietary leaks)

Performer safety & injury-prevention focus

Explicit disclaimer: no autonomous robots, no real harm
